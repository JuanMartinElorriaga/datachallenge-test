# 1. Parse UniProt XML file
# Assume you have already implemented a function to parse the XML file and return a list of UniProt objects.
uniprot_data = parse_uniprot_xml("uniprot.xml")

# 2. Transform data into CSV files
# Create CSV files for nodes and relationships, and write data to the files.
# Here's an example of how you might structure the CSV files for UniProt data:
# Nodes:
#   - UniProtAccession
#   - UniProtId
#   - ProteinName
# Relationships:
#   - UniProtAccession
#   - GOId

with open('uniprot_nodes.csv', 'w') as node_file:
    node_file.write("UniProtAccession,UniProtId,ProteinName\n")
    for uniprot in uniprot_data:
        node_file.write(f"{uniprot.accession},{uniprot.id},{uniprot.protein_name}\n")

with open('uniprot_relationships.csv', 'w') as rel_file:
    rel_file.write("UniProtAccession,GOId\n")
    for uniprot in uniprot_data:
        for go_id in uniprot.go_ids:
            rel_file.write(f"{uniprot.accession},{go_id}\n")

# 3. Use Py2neo to create nodes and relationships
# Connect to the Neo4j database
graph = Graph("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

# Create unique constraints on the UniProtAccession and GOId properties to optimize queries
graph.run("CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (u:UniProt) ASSERT u.UniProtAccession IS UNIQUE")
graph.run("CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (g:GO) ASSERT g.GOId IS UNIQUE")

# Load nodes and relationships from CSV files into the graph
graph.run("""
    LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///uniprot_nodes.csv' AS row
    MERGE (u:UniProt {UniProtAccession: row.UniProtAccession})
    SET u.UniProtId = row.UniProtId, u.ProteinName = row.ProteinName
""")

graph.run("""
    LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///uniprot_relationships.csv' AS row
    MATCH (u:UniProt {UniProtAccession: row.UniProtAccession})
    MERGE (g:GO {GOId: row.GOId})
    MERGE (u)-[:HAS_GO]->(g)
""")

# 4. Add indexes and constraints to optimize queries
# Create an index on the ProteinName property to optimize queries
graph.run("CREATE INDEX ON :UniProt(ProteinName)")

# Add additional constraints as necessary based on your queries
